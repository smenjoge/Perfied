Responsive webpage Homework (wk2) 
1) This is a Portfolio website containing my personal information.
2) It has three pages. Links to these pages are in the top Navigation bar section.
3) 'About' page has some personal details on my educational and professional background. It also has some details on my hobbies.
4) 'Portfolio' page has a few of my favorite images.
5) 'Contact' page can be use to send me messages. 
6) 'Footer' Section at the bottom of page has links to my social networking pages. 
7) To control the links in Navbar at XS and small screen sizes, I had to use media queries. I tried to use the Sass mixin ( @include media-breakpoint-down(md)), but I could not get it to work as I wanted to.
